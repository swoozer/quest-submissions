Chapter 1 Day 1 Quest
- A blockchain is an open, decentralized database where anyone can view, store, and interact with data using SmartContracts. There are many different blockchains, including FLOW and Ethereum.
- A SmartContract consists of coding that enables a user to make transactions on the blockchain. It also sets the "rulebook" of how the data on the blockchain can and cannot be manipulated.
- Scripts allow you to view data on the blockchain. They do not cost money. Transactions allows you to change data on the blockchain and costs money ie. "gas."
